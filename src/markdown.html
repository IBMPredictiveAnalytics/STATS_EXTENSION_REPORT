<h1>STATS EXTENSION REPORT</h1>

<p>This procedure produces a report showing what extension commands
are installed.  It searches all the locations where Statistics looks
for extensions and produces a table showing names, locations, and
other attributes.  It does not include custom dialogs that are not
part of an extension.  The table can be filtered by patterns in the
names of the extension commands.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p>STATS EXTENSION REPORT<br/>
FILTER = "pattern expression"
<p>/HELP</p>

<p><sup>&#42;</sup> Required<br/>
<sup>&#42;&#42;</sup> Default</p>
</div>
<p>STATS EXTENSION REPORT/HELP displays this help and does nothing else.</p>


<pre class="example"><code>
STATS EXTENSION REPORT
/FILTER = "^spssinc".
</code></pre>

<p>With no FILTER, all extensions are listed.  The locations searched
for the report are those listed in the output from the SHOW EXTENSIONS
command plus a variation to accommodate new style extensions such as 
LINEAR LASSO.  Traditional extension bundles have file extension spe.
New style bundles have file extension spxt.<p>
<p>If the same extension has been saved in multiple locations, the one
used will be from the first location where it is found.</p>
<p>The searches are made for the bundle files, but the implementing code
and syntax definition will usually be in the parent directory of the spe or spxt file.</p>

<p>If <strong>FILTER</strong> is specificed, only files whose names match the filter
are displayed.  The filter syntax is formally a regular expression.  You can search
the web for explanations of this mechanism, which is used in many applications.  If you
want to find all the extensions that contain GBM, for example, you could write</br>
FILTER="GBM"</BR>
To find only extensions that start with STATS, you could write</br>
FILTER="^STATS"</br>
The "^" character indictes that the pattern must match at the beginning of the name.

<p>The pattern is applied only to the names not including the location text.</p>
<p>Pattern specifications are not case sensitive</p>
<p>Trailing blanks in the pattern specification are ignored.</p>
